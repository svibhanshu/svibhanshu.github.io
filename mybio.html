  <p>I am a social science researcher with specialization in international relations and public policy. My areas of interest relate to the geopolitics and geoeconomics of Asia, electoral politics in democracies and the political economy of emerging markets. I am currently affiliated as Adjunct Professor American University.</p>
  <p>My latest book entitled Indonesia's Rise: Seeking Regional and Global Roles discusses Indonesia's foreign policy debates as an emerging power. My shorter works have appeared in various international academic journals, newsmagazines, newspapers, and think-tank websites.</p>
